This is my first task - To-Do List!
HTML: sets up the structure of the to-do list app. It includes a form to input new tasks and an unordered list to display them.
CSS: provides the styling for the to-do list app. It centers the container, styles the input and button, and adds some basic styling to the list items.
JavaScript: It adds new tasks to the list, marks tasks as completed when clicked, and removes tasks when the delete button is clicked.
